I'm a Ph.D. student in the Data Intelligence and Learning Lab ([DIAL Lab](https://dial.skku.edu/)) at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), South Korea. I received my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from SKKU in 2020.
My research focuses on Representation learning for Collaborative Filtering, Unbiased Recommender Learning, and Efficient Recommendation. My Curriculum Vitae is [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11kbKMCKhrXcM2FQbfn7-_uPet-62jPyO/view?usp=sharing).
